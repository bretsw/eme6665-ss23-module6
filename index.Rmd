# `r fa("comments", fill = "#fff")` Structure

```{r, out.width = "720px%", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/frame.jpg")
```

Your problem (introduction) and framework sections can help to **provide structure** to your lit review

---

# `r fa("comments", fill = "#fff")` Bridge

```{r, out.width = "720px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/bridge.jpg")
```

Your lit review is a **bridge between** the problem (introduction) and your research questions

---

# `r fa("comments", fill = "#fff")` IFF

```{r, out.width = "600px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/necessary-sufficient.jpg")
```

Your lit review should include only what *must* be there:

--

- "If-and-Only-If: **necessary and sufficient**"

--

- What are the "load-bearing" walls in your lit review?

--

  - *You will actually take care of this in your Introduction section of the prospectus*

--

**✓ Guideline 2:** Early in the Review, Indicate Why the Topic Being Reviewed is Important

--

  - *You should do this in an introductory paragraph at the beginning of the lit review, prior to the sections you've outlined*

--

  - *Include a "roadmap" statement*

--

**✓ Guideline 3:** Distinguish Between Research Findings and Other Sources of Information

--

**✓ Guideline 4:** Indicate Why Certain Studies Are Important

---

### Galvan & Galvan, 2017, Chapter 10
*Guidelines for Writing a First Draft*

<hr>

**✓ Guideline 5:** If You Are Commenting on the Timeliness of a Topic, Be Specific in Describing the Time Frame

--

**✓ Guideline 6:** If Citing a Classic or Landmark Study, Identify It as Such

--

  - *Consider using language like "seminal" or "foundational"*

--

  - *Explain why you consider the study to be this important*

--

**✓ Guideline 8:** Discuss Other Literature Reviews on Your Topic

--

  - *Your work in Module 4 should help here*

--

**✓ Guideline 10:** Justify Comments Such As "No Studies Were Found"

--

**✓ Guideline 11:** Avoid Long Lists of Nonspecific References

### Galvan & Galvan, 2017, Chapter 10
*Guidelines for Writing a First Draft*

<hr>

**✓ Guideline 12:** If the Results of Previous Studies Are Inconsistent of Widely Varying, Cite Them Separately

--

**✓ Guideline 13:** Speculate on the Reasons for Inconsistent Findings in Previous Research

--

  - *Be sure to justify your speculation (i.e., provide evidence)*
  
--

**✓ Guideline 15:** Emphasize the Need for Your Study in the Literature Review Section or Chapter

--

  - *Remember that your lit review is making an argument*

---

# `r fa("fas fa-book-open", fill = "#fff")` General Style

```{r, out.width = "400px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/6-style.jpg")
```

--

- APA style: refer to [Purdue OWL](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_style_introduction.html) often

--

  - Write in the **first person**: "In this study, **I** will..."

--

  - Use singular "**they**" when referring to a cited author

--

  - Use **past tense**: they already said it; they are not necessarily still saying it

--

  - Use "**et al.**" any time you are citing 3 or more authors

--

  - Be careful with **capitalization** and **italics** in your reference list

**Objective:** Provide **constructive feedback** on classmates’ completed subsection assignment.

--

<hr>

Follow the rubric from the *Module 5 Assignment: One Completed Subsection* to:

--

- Assess the strengths and weaknesses of **two** classmates' work.

--

- Keep in mind the kind of feedback you would like to receive on your own work, and try to offer this to your classmates. 

--

- It doesn't help your peers to only say "This is great!" or "This is a mess." Explain why!

--

### Specific comments and suggestions are often the most helpful!
